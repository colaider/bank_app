You must have node js installed 

you must install react-router, react-router-dom, in client folder
and install express and cors in api folder

after that, you must run the api(server) part by "npm start" command
and after that you mast start the client side by same command

When all started you can goiby "http://localhost:3000" and check

Thanks for your attention
